## new-portfolio

# what it is
This is my personal portfolio website built using React with Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion, meant to introduce myself to those who don't know me and display my projects and skills! 

# why i made it
I created this project because I wanted to upgrade my old portfolio from January (it was miserable) now that I have more projects and experience under my belt. I also wanted to get more familiar with more advanced web development using popular frameworks like React! 

# how i made it
As briefly mentioned previously, this website runs on React. The styling is done mainly through Tailwind CSS but also with some custom styling and overrides, and the animation is done with Framer motion. The cursor is from cursify, and the live demo runs on Vercel. 

# resources
I started creating this website during a virtual Hack Club workshop for the Shipwrecked event (I am submitting this project for Shipwrecked too, you should totally check it out [here](https://shipwrecked.hackclub.com/) if you are unfamiliar!), but I ended up having to leave the worshop super early so couldn't get much done or much feedback other than basic setup. As someone who was new to React and pretty new to Javascript, this meant using a lot of docs and online resources, along with the assistance of AI tools such as Copilot or ChatGPT to help me apply something from a tutorial or guide to my code specifically or help me figure out why something wasn't working and how to fix it. Some of the specific resources I used are listed below.
