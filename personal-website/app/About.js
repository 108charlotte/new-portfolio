            <p>
                At school, I am a programmer for Westminster's FIRST robotics team, 2415, and a Mu Alpha Theta executive council member. 
                On my own time, I am a passion-driven programmer who loves to build cool projects!

                I believe in learning by doing. After months of studying programming online, I realized that endless courses weren’t helping me create unique, impressive projects. 
                So, I chose to switch to a project-based approach--after only a few weeks, it transformed my growth—I began building projects that truly interested me and, along the way, learned to use powerful new frameworks and tools. 
                Now, I'm excited to share my journey and show the world how rewarding it is to pursue your own ideas!
